From the simple question “What is a container, really?” I began building the Rust-based container runtime youki and watched it grow. This talk walks through container runtime fundamentals, a quick hands-on of crafting a tiny runtime, and what makes youki unique—rootless support, cgroup v2, and how the community has been developing it.
