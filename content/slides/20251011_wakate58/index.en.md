At last year's Wakate-no-kai, Suda-san gave a keynote on "Why we should contribute to open source software," which clarified the value of OSS contributions. This year's talk shares the maintainer's side: how contributions and project operations actually work in practice.

I have led development of the container runtime youki for more than four years. Drawing on that maintainer experience, I cover the challenges and decision-making behind running OSS projects, with concrete examples. I also share practices I've used to keep an OSS project healthy and continuously growing. I hope this talk helps raise your resolution on OSS and gives you a clearer picture of effective contribution.
