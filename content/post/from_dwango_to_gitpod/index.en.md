## ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ Dwango

I have decided to retire from Dwango, a Japanese IT company, at the end of this year. [^1]
I've been with Dwango for 2 years and 9 months since I joined the company as a new graduate.

At Dwango, I mainly worked on the common infrastructure in Scala and sometimes did a little front-end engineering.
I was able to work with excellent engineers in a very nice environment, which made me feel comfortable and I enjoyed my time there.

Then, "Why do you quit?" I decided to change the environment a little bit to a lower layer [^2] and try it while I was young.
I've always been interested in lower layer technology, so I'm going to try to work in a field that is as close to that as possible.
Also, I had the opportunity to experience being the a mentor.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Gitpod

Starting next January, I'll be working for a German company [gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) as a senior container runtime engineer. I will be living in Berlin when the weather gets warmer.
Gitpod is something that can reduce the stress of building your development environment.
You can use gitpod at [nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell#learning-more), so you can try it out if you want.

Gitpod is developing as [OSS](https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod). It is one of the fun things to be able to experience such a culture.

I will do my best to make your OSS development and programming at work more comfortable.

## ðŸ’¬ Conclusion

Right now, I'm feeling a mixture of anticipation and anxiety, but I'm going to do my best to make the container technology you're using as comfortable and robust as possible.

I don't have a wish list or anything like that, so if you could comment on Twitter, that would be great!

[^1]: I'll be around for a bit more at the beginning of next year, to be exact.
[^2]: I've heard that containers are not low layers
