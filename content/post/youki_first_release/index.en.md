## ü§î What is youki?

Youki is a low level container runtime written in Rust that implements the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/main/spec.md). Simply put, youki is a commandline tool that can create containers. Other runtimes in the same category you might have heard about are [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) and [crun](https://github.com/containers/crun). When you create a container using Docker or Podman the actual container creation is delegated to a tool like youki.

## Why another container runtime?

Currently many container tools are implemented in Go which requires special handling when it comes to implementing a container runtime. Runc for example embeds a C program into its exectuable that handles setting up the namespaces as this is not possible in Go due to the multithreaded nature of the Go runtime. 

On the other hand C could be used as a implementation language but this comes at the cost of memory safety and in addition C lacks high level language constructs that we have come to expect from a modern language. 

Therefore while Go and C are perfectly fine languages, for this particular use case we believe that Rust with its cross section of low level control, memory safety and high level abstractions is uniquely suited for implementing a container runtime.

Youki has the potential to be faster and use less memory than runc, and therefore work in environments with tight memory usage requirements. Here is a simple benchmark of a container from creation to deletion. As with all benchmarks, this might not be representative of your own workloads

## Implementation status

A container runtime needs to to implement many features that users have come to expect from a container runtime, that have not yet been incorporated into the OCI Runtime Specification. Despite this being the first release of youki, many features have already been implemented.

## How to get started

Download youki from [the release](https://github.com/containers/youki/releases/tag/v0.0.1) page and follow the [tutorial](https://github.com/containers/youki#tutorial).
See [the mdbook](https://containers.github.io/youki/) for more details.

## üí™ Motivation

Why do we keep implementing youki?

* Contribution to the container runtime community  
We are trying to provide as much of the crates used to make youki to the community. Currently we are providing [containers/oci-spec-rs](https://github.com/containers/oci-spec-rs) as a crate, separated from youki's main code. We have already crates available for [cgroups](https://github.com/containers/youki/tree/main/crates/libcgroups), [container creation](https://github.com/containers/youki/tree/main/crates/libcontainer), [seccomp](https://github.com/containers/youki/tree/main/crates/libseccomp) and [oci-cli parsing](https://github.com/containers/youki/tree/main/crates/liboci-cli) which will be released at a later point in time.

* Explore  
Youki does not provide any support for older kernels. By doing so, it has the potential to use new features such as `io_uring`, `clone3` and `webassembly`. 

* Fun
We have fun implementing this. In fact, this might be the most important part.
